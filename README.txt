Research Question
Do UK migration patterns follow wealth inequality and deprivation patterns in local councils?

Hypothesis:
Migration from high income areas increase wealth inequality in the area they migrate to.

Conclusion 
To conclude, the results provide little evidence that migration from high-income origin areas is a key driver of short-term change in income inequality measured by the Foster Wolfson index. Detailed models suggested that the relationship could differ across age groups; however, these patterns were not statistically robust when tested against simple models. This indicates that the association between migration and inequality is weak. More detailed data or longer time periods would be needed to identify any clearer distributional effects. A major limitation of our work was created by the substantial reduction in sample size that occurred during the data cleaning and merging process. As a result, the final dataset used for analysis contained fewer than 50 rows. This reduction likely limited the statistical power of the models, making it harder to determine effects if they existed. Also, the use of year-on-year change in inequality may underestimate longer-term effects of migration, which may be more visible over longer time frames due to factors such as housing markets and labour. With more time or data access, we could have tried to extend the analysis over longer time scales or different types of lagging variables.
