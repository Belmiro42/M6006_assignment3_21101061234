Both Cleaning_Deprivation.ipynb and Cleaning_Migration.ipynb are dependent on tables exported by Cleaning_Migration.ipynb
This is jarring because we need to do the below on Cleaning_Migration.ipynb then need to reru

In Cleaning_Migration.ipynb we still need to:
    Impute Values for 50th percentile aka Median for those areas that are missing them. 
        Can be done by taking left / right values for extreme ends and average of left right for middle cells.
    Remove Councils from income table that have significant amount of missing values.

Analysis:
     Foster–Wolfson Polarization Index on all income data to compute "Income Inequality" (New Column on Table)
     "Year of Year Change" on "Income Inequality" (New Column on Table)
     Relationship of "Year on Year Change" to "Migration Data" and make a regression model.
     Map "Deprivation Indices" to "Income Inequality" to see if there is a relationship
